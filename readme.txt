-----  Basic for Playing  ------

  I've done quite a bit of work on the in-game documentation, though it never
  seems to be a completable task. If you are new to the game, I recommend you
  read the Newbie Guide (Press ? to activate the help system, then choose a for
  General Information followed by e). This will give a quick tutorial as well
  as some additional information about the game. Helpfiles are also available
  as html files for viewing outside the game in your favorite browser. In this
  case, open lib/help/html/tang.html.

---------  Commands  ----------- 

  Again, please refer to the in-game help (It hurts me to keep the same information
  up to date in multiple places). Press ? for help and then k for Commands. Choose
  the topic that interests you (Command Descriptions for an overview, or one of the
  Keyset options for reference on which keys to press).

  Or open lib/help/html/commdesc.html or lib/help/html/command.html in your browser.
